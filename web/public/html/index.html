                            <h3>HOW TO PLAY</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Choose to play against the computer or with
                                    a friend
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Press on a piece to select it and then
                                    choose a move or jump, press it again to put
                                    it down
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Always keep your pieces doubled up
                                    diagonally to block your opponent's jumps
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Quickly get your pieces promoted to kings so
                                    they can move forward and backward across
                                    the board
                                </li>
                                Try to lure your opponent into a double or
                                triple jump trap
                                <li>
                                    Use the side of the board to prevent being
                                    jumped, but don't get stuck!
                                </li>

                    <h2>ABOUT CHECKERS</h2>
                    <div class="double-row-holder row">
                        <div class="double-row-row">
                            <h3>RULES</h3>
                            <p>
                                The goal of Checkers is to remove all your
                                opponent's pieces from the board or prevent them
                                from making a move.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Pieces move diagonally, always staying on the
                                dark squares. Pieces can "slide" to an adjacent
                                open square or "jump" over an opponent's pieces,
                                removing them from the board. Normal pieces move
                                toward the opposite side of the board.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                If the force jumps rule is in effect, the player
                                must make a jump move when available. In the
                                event of a double or triple jump opportunity,
                                only the first jump is required.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                When a normal piece reaches the last row on the
                                opposite side of the board it is promoted into a
                                "King" piece. Promoted pieces may move towards
                                either side of the board.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The game is over when one player has no
                                remaining pieces or can't make any valid moves.
                                You may also elect a draw if each team only has
                                1 king remaining.

                                Checkers is a popular classic board game for two
                                players. The earliest version of a checkers
                                style game has been around for more than 5,000

                            </p>
                            <p>

                                change rules, board size, and number of pieces.
                                Tabletop Checkers incorporates 3 versions of
                                checkers:
